What is your Favorite Dinosaur app <br>
Would like to work in Ed Tech! Here is an app for elemetary school ages.

This app contains:
- multiple css files to style the app and the component
    - flexbox utilized for alignment
- useState
- map
- event handlers
 
 This project was created coding along with Stephen Grider's Modern React with Redux [2023 Update] but content, images, and styling were changed.
 Dinosaur images were taked from flat icon.
